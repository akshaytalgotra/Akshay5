# Getting started

This sample uses the Gradle build system.

Download the samples by cloning this repository or downloading an archived snapshot. (See the options at the top of the page.)

In Android Studio, create a new project and choose the "Import non-Android Studio project" or "Import Project" option.

If prompted for a gradle configuration, accept the default settings. Alternatively use the "gradlew build" command to build the project directly.

Add your API key to your app's gradle.properties file. (For information on getting an API key, see the documentation.)
